Started.html":{"url":"Getting Started.html","title":"1. Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"1 Getting Started\nIt is recommended to use totem database in the following configurations：\nOS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64-bit\nMemory: 8G RAM\nHard disk: 20G\n1.1 Installation\n  Totem can be installed by any unprivileged user and does not require superuser(root) privileges. The steps to install Totem on an ubuntu system are as follows.\n (1) Create the totem user\n You should set up a dedicated user name for the database, such as totem, as the superuser of Totem at runtime. Enter the command：\nadduser totem\nThere is a security problem when running as root, bin or other special privilege user. In fact, tmaster refuses to run as root.\n(2) Download deb package\nDownload the deb installation package of totem from the website of Luojia Totem Lab.\n(3) Install\nsudo dpkg -i totem_1.0-1_amd64.deb\nThe default installation location is: /usr/local/totem\n(4) Modify directory permissions\nModify /usr/local/totem permissions\ncd /usr/local\nsudo chown -R totem totem\nAfter completing the above steps, the Totem database system has been installed. You still need to initialize the database before you can start the database service.\n1.2 Launching the database\nYou need to initialize the database directory before launching the database. Create Totem's data directory in the /usr/local/totem directory and do the\nInitialize.\nmkdir /usr/local/totem/data\n/usr/local/totem/bin/initdb -D ../data #在totem用户下执行\nAfter successful connection using tsql, you can see the following image.\n\n1.3 Create the database\nThe first example to see if you can access a database server is to try to create a database. A running TOTEM server can manage many databases. Usually we use a separate database for each project and each user. Your node administrator may have already created a database for Your node administrator has probably already created a database for you to use. He should have told you the name of this database. If so, you can skip this step and\nskip to the next section. To create a new database, called mydb in our example, you can use the following command.\n$ ./createdb mydb #Execute this command under /usr/local/totem/bin\nIt should generate a response like this.\n\nIf so, then this step is successful and you can ignore the rest of this section.\nIf you see a similar message that reads：\ncreatedb: could not connect to database totem: could not connect to server:\nNo such file or directory\nIs the server running locally and accepting\nconnections on Unix domain socket \"/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432\"?\nThis means that the server is not started, or not started where createdb expects it to be. Again, you will want to check the installation instructions or find the administrator.\nAnother response might be something like:\ncreatedb: could not connect to database totem: FATAL: user \"joe\" does not exist\nYour own login name is mentioned here. If the administrator did not create TOTEM user account for you, the following will happen (TOTEM user account and OS user account are different). You need to become the identity of the OS user who installed TOTEM (usually totem) to create your first user account. It is also possible that the TOTEM user name given to you and your operating system user name are different. In this case, you need to declare your TOTEM user name using the -U switch or using the PGUSER environment variable.\nIf you have a database user account, but do not have the permissions needed to create the database, then you will see something like the following.\ncreatedb: database creation failed: ERROR: permission denied to create database\nNot all users are authorized to create new databases. If TOTEM refuses to create a database for you, then you need to ask your node administrator to grant you permission to create a database. Please consult your node administrator when this happens. If you installed TOTEM yourself, then you should log in as the user who started the database server and then refer to the manual to complete the privilege granting process.\nTOTEM allows you to create any number of databases on a node. Database names must start with a letter and have a maximum length of 31 characters. A convenient approach is to create databases with the same name as your current username. Many tools assume that the database name is the default database name, so this will save you work. To create such a database, simply type\n$ ./createdb\nIf you don't want to use your database anymore, then you can delete it. For example, if you are the owner of the database mydb (created person), then you can delete it with the following command.\n$ ./dropdb mydb\n1.4 Accessing the database\nOnce you have created a database, you can access it by. Running the TOTEM terminal monitor program tsql, where you can enter, edit and execute SQL commands. The next section describes how to run tsql, using the previous example of mydb. Enter the command . /tsql mydb and you will see the following response.\n\nThe prompt mydb=# indicates that you are in the terminal monitor and can type SQL queries into the workspace managed by the terminal monitor.\nThe monitor program tsql responds to special commands that begin with the backslash character '\\'.\nFor example, you can type the following command to get syntax help for various TOTEM SQL commands:\nmydb=# \\h\n\nOnce you have finished entering your query into the workspace, you can type the following to submit your workspace to the server:\nmydb=> \\g\nThis sentence tells the server to process the query. If your query ends in a semicolon, you do not need to use the \"\\g\" command; tdsql will automatically process queries ending in a semicolon queries that end with a semicolon.\nTo read a query from a file, such as myFile, rather than typing it on the command line, type:\n\\i myFile\nExit from tsql back to UNIX, type:\n\\q\nThen tsql will exit and go back to your command line. Blanks (e.g., empty spaces, tabs and newlines, etc.) can be used freely in SQL queries. Single line comments use \"--\". All content on that line that follows this symbol in that line will be ignored. For multi-line comments or intra-line comments, use \"/ ... /\".\n1.5 Database Configuration\nThe configuration file is named totem.conf and is located in the database cluster directory. It includes the listening ip and port, database log settings, memory parameter settings (shared memory, temporary memory). settings (shared memory, temporary memory). Changes are made under this configuration file according to the needs of the application.\nClient authentication is controlled by a configuration file (usually named totem_hba.conf ), which is stored in the data directory of the database cluster. HBA stands for \"host-based authentication\". When initdb initializes the data directory, it installs a default When initdb initializes the data directory, it installs a default totem_hba.conf file.\nThe common format of the totem_hba.conf file is a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, and comments starting with the # symbol are ignored. are ignored. Records cannot exist across lines. A record consists of a number of fields separated by spaces and/or tabs. If a field is enclosed in quotation marks then it can contain whitespace. Quoting a keyword (e.g., all or replication) in a database, user, or address file causes the word to lose its special meaning. The word loses its special meaning and is simply used to match a database, user, or host with that name.\nEach record declares a connection type, a range of client IP addresses (if relevant to the connection type), a database name, a user name, and the authentication method used for connections that match these parameters. The first record matching the connection type, client address, database name and user name of the connection request will be The first record matching the connection type, the client address, the database name and the user name of the connection request will be used to perform the authentication. There is no \"leapfrogging\" or \"backtracking\" in this process: if a record is selected and authentication fails, it will no longer be used, the subsequent records are not considered. If there is no matching record, then access is denied.\nEach record can be in one of the following seven formats:\nlocal database user auth-method [auth-options]\nhost database user address auth-method [auth-options]\nhostssl database user address auth-method [auth-options]\nhostnossl database user address auth-method [auth-options]\nhost database user IP-address IP-mask auth-method [auth-options]\nhostssl database user IP-address IP-mask auth-method [auth-options]\nhostnossl database user IP-address IP-mask auth-method [auth-options]\n"},"Use of the database.html":{"url":"Use of the database.html","title":"2. Use of the Database","keywords":"","body":"2 Use of the Database\n2.1 Introduction\nThis chapter provides an overview of how to perform simple operations using SQL in TOTEM. In the examples that follow, we assume that you have created a database named mydb and have started tsql.\nTOTEM is a database management system based on the object-agent model. The concept of storing data in tables has become almost inherently common knowledge It is one of the most basic concepts of a relational database; however, there are other ways to organize a database. Files and directories on Unix-like operating systems are examples of hierarchical databases. A more modern development is the object-oriented database. Compared to the traditional object-oriented The object-agent model is more flexible, more flexible, and easier to use than the traditional object-oriented model.\n2.2 Basic concept of Proxy\nThe so-called \"proxy\" refers to the process of switching all or some properties of an object (source object), such as name change, operation, etc., to derive another object (proxy object). The process of deriving another object (proxy object) by performing certain switching operations on all or some of the properties of an object (source object), such as name change, arithmetic, and so on. Through object proxies, the user can split and combine different objects to form new views. The object proxy allows the user to combine different objects into a new view of the object. Compared with the original object-oriented model, the object proxy model is more flexible, operation It is more flexible and easier to use.\nBoth source and proxy objects belong to their own classes. Thus, the concept of source and proxy classes is formed. Proxy objects with switching operations and modes are gathered in a proxy class. There is a difference between a proxy class \"proxying\" the source class and \"inheriting\" in the general sense. A proxy class is more like a view of the source class. The proxy class is more like a view of the source class, with different proxy objects representing different roles played by the source object. Multiple proxy classes can be defined at the same time on a source class. Proxy Classes It is possible to proxy on several source classes at the same time by concatenation or merge operations. It is also possible to define additional proxy classes on a proxy class. It can also define other proxy classes on the proxy class. Proxy relationships are in the shape of a directed graph. The classes at the top of the proxy hierarchy are called base classes, and they can be considered are proxy classes without source classes.\nIn the storage model, the objects of the basic class occupy the storage space and store the actual data. Most of the data in the database is stored in the base class. Proxy properties (called \"dummy properties\") in proxy objects only have schema and no actual physical data elements. Between the source object and the proxy object are linked by bidirectional pointers, and a switch operation determines the value of the dummy property in the proxy object. Proxy objects can extend their own properties The proxy object can extend its own properties, but it is these extended properties that actually occupy the storage space.\nThe definition of a proxy class is somewhat similar to the definition of a view in a relational database. For general query operations, the proxy class is exactly the same as a normal class. The proxy class is exactly the same as a normal class when it comes to general query operations.\n2.3 Creating a basic class\nThe creation of a base class or proxy class in TOTEM corresponds to the creation of a table in traditional relational data. Basic classes are classes without source classes, they are the most basic classes and all their properties are real properties. It is essentially the same as a relational table, but it has methods. So we define a set of commands for the basic class,  which are similar to those for defining a basic table in a relational database, including: defining the class name, attribute name and attribute type; establishing constraints, such as whether the attribute is allowed to be null, the default value of the attribute, etc.; creating a method, defining the method name, parameter type, return type, and and function body.\nFor example, the SQL statement to define a basic class (which stores information about all faculty members) faculty is as follows:\nCREATE CLASS faculty\n(\nId INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,\nName VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,\nbirth INT,\ndepartment VARCHAR(30),\nsalary INT\n);\n2.4  Creating a proxy class\nDefining a proxy class requires a proxy rule (essentially a query statement) to define the formal transformations to be performed on the source class. In order to ensure the clarity of the proxy relationship, the proxy rules must be somewhat qualified. In the object proxy model, only four simple proxy rules，which are Select, Join, Union, and Group proxies.\nThe proxy rules can be defined with certain semantic constraints, so that the object being proxied meets certain conditions. When an object is updated, the system automatically maintains the proxy rules according to these conditions. When an object is updated, the system automatically maintains consistency between objects based on these conditions. If no semantic constraints are declared, then a loose proxy class is defined (see the rest of this section) in which the objects are maintained manually by the user.\n2.4.1 Define Select proxy class\nSelect type proxy allows to select only the source object from a class to be proxied. The source object and the proxy object are one-to-one correspondence.\nA select proxy class for the faculty class can be created by the following statement.\nCREATE SELECTDEPUTYCLASS computer_faculty (field VARCHAR(30))\nAS\n(SELECT id, name, (extract(year from current_date) - birth) AS age FROM faculty\nWHERE department ='computer')\nWRITE (faculty.birth = 'extract(year from current_date)－age');\nThe computer_faculty proxy class directly inherits the id, name attributes from the source class faculty, and adds an attribute field to represent the faculty's area of expertise. The value of the birth attribute is converted to age by the expression (extract(year from current_date)-birth) AS age.\nThe constraint WHERE department = 'computer' declares that the proxy class only proxies objects in the faculty class that belong to the computer department. The WRITE clause defines a write-switch operation for the age dummy attribute. It allows the age attribute to be updated.\nIf the following query is made after the definition:\n\nAs you can see, only the teachers in the computer department have been selected. Age property corresponds to the value of birth. Field is empty for now. Because this field does not proxy any source class data, you can only enter its value with the update command after the proxy class is created. As follows:\nUPDATE computer_faculty SET field ='Database' WHERE name ='jack';\nUPDATE computer_faculty SET field ='Network' WHERE name ='john\nQuerying the class again returns the following results:\n\n2.4.2 Defining the Join proxy class\nJoin type proxy is a proxy on the result of the connection of several classes. It can achieve the effect of \"multiple inheritance\" like presentation. A proxy object in each source class corresponds to a source object.\nExample: Create a proxy class assistant to store information about all students (both students and teachers).\nCREATE JOINDEPUTYCLASS assistant\nAS\n( SELECT student.name, salary FROM student,faculty\nWHERE student.id = faculty.id );\nQuert result:\n\nYou can see that the assistant object has the properties of both source classes.\n2.4.3 Defining the Union proxy class\nUnion proxy is equivalent to combining the results of several select proxies in a single proxy class.\nExample: Create a union proxy class person for students and faculty, abstracting the two types of objects into one object of the same pattern.\nCREATE UNIONDEPUTYCLASS person\nAS\n( SELECT name, birth FROM student UNION\nSELECT name, birth FROM faculty);\nselect * from person;\nQuert result:\n\nIt can be seen that the set of objects of the person class is a concatenation of the student and faculty classes.\n2.4.4 Defining the Group proxy class\nGroup-type proxies are proxies that group on a single class. Although, like the select proxy, it requires a proxy class to correspond to only one source Group proxies generally contain aggregation operations in their rules.\nExample: Creating a group proxy class for faculty\nCREATE GROUPDEPUTYCLASS dept_size\nAS\n( SELECT COUNT(id) AS size, department AS dept_name FROM faculty group by\ndepartment);\nThis proxy class counts the total number of teachers in each school department. Execute the query:\nselect * from dept_size;\nReturn:\n\n2.4.5 Defining loose proxy classes\nThe proxy classes defined in the previous sections all contain semantic constraints and are called strict proxy classes. Once a strict proxy class is defined, the set of objects in it is automatically determined by the system based on the constraints and cannot be arbitrarily inserted or removed by the user. A proxy class that does not contain semantic constraints in the proxy rules is called a loose proxy class. After definition, the set of objects in the loose proxy class is maintained manually by the user.\nThe difference between the proxy rules of a loose proxy class and a strict proxy class is that:\n\nIMPRECISE keyword must be written;\n\nno semantic constraints can be declared;\n\n\nAn example of creating a non-strict select proxy class for the student class is given below. This class is used to store information about \"my friends\". It is up to the user to determine which objects in the student class can be \"my friends\".\nCREATE IMPRECISE SELECTDEPUTYCLASS my_friends(telephone int)\nAS ( SELECT name FROM student);\n2.5  Adding objects to a class\nTOTEM appends objects to a class in two cases.\n  (1) creating new objects in the base class.\n  (2) Appending objects to a loose proxy class \n2.5.1  Appending objects to basic classes\nThe INSERT command is used to create a new object in the basic class with the following syntax structure:\nINSERT INTO class [ ( column [, ...] ) ]\n{ DEFAULT VALUES | VALUES ( expression [, ...] ) | SELECT query }\nThe INSERT statement is entered as\n\nclass, the name of the existing base class.\nCOLUMN, the name of the field in the class.\nDEFAULT VALUES, where all fields are populated with NULL or the value declared with the DEFAULT clause at creation.\nexpression , a valid expression or value given to the column.\nQUERY, a valid query.\n\nThe output of the INSERT statement is.\n\nINSERT oid 1, if only one object is inserted, returns this information, where oid is the numeric identifier of the object being inserted.\nINSERT 0 # returns this information if multiple objects were inserted, where # is the number of objects inserted.\n\nINSERT allows us to insert new objects into the class. We can insert multiple objects at once, and the columns/fields in the target list can be in any order. Columns/fields that do not appear in the target column will be inserted with default values: DEFAULT values defined or NULL. If a NULL value is inserted into a column defined as NOT NULL, TOTEM will reject the new object. If the expression is not of the correct data type, an attempt will be made to perform automatic type conversion. To insert data into a class, you must have insert permission, and also have select permission to handle any classes declared in the WHERE clause. Note that the \"columns/fields\" mentioned here correspond to the properties of the object.\nAn example of the first INSERT usage: insert an object into the films. The command is as follows:\nINSERT INTO films VALUES\n('UA502','Bananas',105,'1971-07-13','Comedy',INTERVAL '82 minute');\nThe second usage example also inserts an object into the films, which omits the field len, so the default value of len will be stored as NULL.\nThe command is as follows:\nINSERT INTO films (code, title, did, date_prod, kind)\nVALUES ('T_601', 'Yojimbo', 106, DATE '1961-06-16', 'Drama');\nThe user can also insert an object from another class tmp into the films with the following command:\nINSERT INTO films SELECT * FROM tmp;\n2.5.2 Appending objects to loose proxy classes\nAppend objects to the loose proxy class with ADD INTO, the syntax structure of the statement is as follows:\nADD ANY|INEXISTENT INTO name FROM source WHERE condition\nThe ADD INTO command can only be used for loose proxy classes. Loose proxy classes are created without any objects, so if the user wants to add some objects from the source class to the If you want to add some objects from the source class to the loose proxy class, you need to use this command.\nThe ADD INTO syntax is explained as follows:\n\nANY, regardless of whether the object selected in the where clause has already been proxied or not, adds it to the proxy class, so that one\nobject in the proxy class corresponds to more than one proxy object.\nINEXISTENT, in contrast to ANY, if the source object selected in the where clause is found to have already existed in the proxy class for at least one\nname, the name of the inserted target class.\nsource, the name of the source class to which the Source object belongs.\ncondition, a Boolean expression used to select the source object, which may not contain subqueries.\n\nThe output of the ADD INTO statement is:\n\nCOUNT, success, returns the number of joined objects.\nERROR: can not insert into a precise deputy class, that is, TOTEM prohibits the use of ADD INTO to strictly proxy class Adding objects\n\n2.6 Query\nThe query language of the object proxy database provides support for querying classes and proxy classes, and also provides cross-class querying based on path expressions. The query language of the object proxy database provides support for querying classes and proxy classes. For common queries (meaning queries that do not involve proxy classes and proxy objects), the query processing process of object proxy database can follow the common implementation methods of traditional databases are used. However, for the query processing involving the virtual properties of the proxy class, special processing is needed to make the proxy class queries can be described and implemented in the same form as the queries of traditional databases. TOTEM, an object proxy database system, has established a comprehensive query mechanism, which makes it possible for users to query classes and proxies freely and transparently, and also implements a special navigational query mechanism, i.e., cross-class queries. In the object proxy database, proxy relationships between (proxy) objects are represented by physical address pointer links.\nThe proxy relationships between (proxy) objects are represented by physical address pointer links. Therefore, the objects form an object hierarchy connected by proxy relationships. Using the object hierarchy, you can start from a (proxy) object of a (proxy) class and class, you can query the (proxy) objects of other (proxy) classes that are directly or indirectly related to it. Cross-class queries make use of a path of object pointers between (proxy) objects is formed, and a path expression is used to reflect the syntactic structure of the path.\n2.6.1 General Query\nA query is a procedure or command that retrieves data from a database, TOTEM uses the SELECT command to declare a query. The generic SELECT command syntax is:\nSELECT select_list FROM class_expression [sort_specification]\nThe various parts of the SELECT syntax are described in detail next.\nThe simplest form of the query is as follows:\nSELECT * FROM class1;\nAssuming there is a class called class1, this command will retrieve all properties of all objects from class1. Selecting a column declaration * means that all properties provided by the class expression. It is also possible to select a subset of the optional columns and even compute the properties before retrieving them. Suppose class1 has attributes a, b, and c, then you can use the following query:\nSELECT a, b + c FROM class1;\nFROM class1 is a very simple class expression (class_expression). Typically, class expressions can be complex constructs of basic classes, proxy classes, joins, and subqueries. However, you can also omit the class expression record and use the SELECT command as a calculator, such as SELECT 3 * 4. The expressions in the select_list (a,b+c in the above example) can also return varying results. For example, you can call a function with this method:\nSELECT random();\nThe class_expression in the SELECT a, b + c FROM class1 example is very simple, containing only one class, class1. The class expression in the SELECT a, b + c FROM class1 example is very simple, containing only one class, class1.\nThe class expression can actually be used with WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses as needed. These clauses declare a series of class expressions for classes that originate from the FROM clause (i.e., the class to be queried), and the resulting class is used to generate the output, which is based on the select_list. Class expressions support complex transformations of classes, such as join classes. A join class is based on the rules of a specific join type Classes derived from two other classes, specifically TOTEM supports INNER, OUTER and CROSS JOIN connection types.\n2.6.2 Cross-Class Query\nTo clearly describe cross-class queries, a detailed example is given here. Again, consider the cross-media data management scenario where a user wants to see to see other users' comments on a certain song, then first give the schema diagram for this scenario as follows:\n\nmusic_lyr_TheBeatles_user1, music_lyr_TheBeatles_user2 are both proxy classes of music_lyr; music_lyr stores lyrics and songs, and its proxy class stores information such as user ratings, albums and lyrics.\nIf user1 wants to see user2's comments on the same songs belonging to the album \"The Beatles\", a simple cross-class query can achieve this, the specific SQL statement is as follows:\nSELECT (music_lyr_TheBeatles_user1-> music_lyr_TheBeatles_user2).comments\nFROM music_lyr_TheBeatles_user1\nWHERE title=‘TheOne’;\nNote: When using cross-class queries you need to use parentheses to include the included paths, and you cannot use * for queries, e.g.:\n#Brackets not used\nSELECT music_lyr_TheBeatles_user1-> music_lyr_TheBeatles_user2.comments\nFROM music_lyr_TheBeatles_user1\nWHERE title=‘TheOne’;\n#Unable to query all properties using *\nSELECT (music_lyr_TheBeatles_user1-> music_lyr_TheBeatles_user2).*\nFROM music_lyr_TheBeatles_user1\nWHERE title=‘TheOne’\n2.7 Update Object\nThe user can update an existing object with the UPDATE command. Suppose you find that all the thermometer counts for November 28 are two degrees lower, then you can update the data in the following way:\nUPDATE weather SET temp_hi = temp_hi - 2, temp_lo = temp_lo - 2 WHERE date > '1994-11-28';\nThe new state of the object is shown below:\nSELECT * FROM weather;\ncity | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp | date\n---------------+---------+---------+------+------------\nSan Francisco | 46 | 50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27\nSan Francisco | 41 | 55 | 0 | 1994-11-29\nHayward | 35 | 52 | | 1994-11-29\n(3 rows)\n2.8 Delete Object\nThe user can remove objects from the class with the DELETE command. Suppose you are no longer interested in Hayward's weather, then you can remove those objects from the class with the following method to remove those objects from the class:\nDELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';\nAll weather records belonging to Hayward will be deleted.\nSELECT * FROM weather;\ncity | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp | date\n---------------+---------+---------+------+------------\nSan Francisco | 46 | 50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27\nSan Francisco | 41 | 55 | 0 | 1994-11-29\n(2 rows)\nWe must be careful when using statements of the following form:\nDELETE FROM classname;\nIf there is no condition, DELETE will remove all objects from the specified class, emptying it. The system will not ask you for confirmation until you do this!\n"},"Maintenance of the database.html":{"url":"Maintenance of the database.html","title":"3. Maintenance of the Database","keywords":"","body":"3 Maintenance of the Database\n3.1 Daily cleaning\nAs the database runs for a long time, it causes a lot of junk data and loss of old data. In order to keep the built database running smoothly, we have to do some maintenance work. The tasks discussed here are mainly restoring disk space, updating planner statistics, maintaining log files, and recovering OIDs. All these tasks are performed by using the vacuum command. So, the system administrator needs to run vacuum periodically to make the database run faster.\nIn normal database operations, an UPDATE or DELETE on a row does not immediately delete the old tuple (version of the row). This method is necessary to getting the benefit of parallel control of multiple versions is necessary. But after a long time, no transaction cares about the data that has expired, and it is necessary to reclaim the physical space occupied by these records.\nWhen cleaning, you can define a class to be cleaned (this is mainly for those who do frequent deletion updates) This is less expensive, you can set a periodic cron task to clean those selected classes and ignore those classes that are already known to change less; the second way is cleaning up all classes of the entire database. In this case, the cleanup is more complete but more costly, requiring the entire database to be frozen, so we recommend scheduling a VACUUM of the entire database at a low-use time of day. If there are multiple databases in the system, don't forget to VACUUM each database separately (see the vacuumdb script).\nVACUUM, the standard VACUUM, maintains the stable state of the disk: finds old data and marks the physical space it occupies as available.\nVACUUM FULL, in addition to performing the work of a standard VACUUM, performs a disk cleanup of the entire class and returns all free space to the operating system. In general, for classes that are updated frequently, a medium frequency VACUUM is more appropriate than a low frequency VACUUM FULL.For most of the deleted tuples in a class, we recommend using VACUUM FULL so that the steady-state size of the class can be significantly reduced by VACUUM FULL's more aggressive approach.\n3.2 Backup and Recovery\nThe idea behind the SQL dump method is to create a text file full of SQL commands, which when fed back to the server will rebuild the database in the same state as when it was dumped. TOTEM provides the application tool totem_dump for this purpose. The basic usage of this command is：\ntotem_dump dbname > outfile\nAs you can see, totem_dump outputs the results to standard output. We can see below what the benefits of this are. totem_dump is a normal TOTEM client application that allows you to back up the data in a database with this command But you must have read access to all the contents of the database, which is usually required of the database administrator. Use totem_dump --help to see more totem_dump usage.\n"},"Android Studio Installation & Use.html":{"url":"Android Studio Installation & Use.html","title":"4.
